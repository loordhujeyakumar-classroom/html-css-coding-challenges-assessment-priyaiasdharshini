# Challenge 2: Product Card Challenge

## Challenge Description:

Your task is to create a visually appealing product card using HTML and CSS. The product card should display information about a product, including an image, name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

## Design Description:

- The product card should be a rectangular container with a defined width (e.g., 300-350px).
- It should include:
  - A prominent product image at the top.
  - The product name displayed in a larger, bolder font below the image.
  - A brief product description underneath the name.
  - The product price, clearly displayed, possibly with a currency symbol.
  - An "Add to Cart" button, styled to be visually prominent and interactive.
- Use subtle visual enhancements like box-shadow, rounded corners (border-radius), and consistent spacing to make the card appealing.
- The card should be centered on the page or within its containing section.

**Visual Style:**

- **Color Palette:** Use a light background color for the card container (e.g., white or a very light gray), a primary color for text (e.g., dark gray or black), an accent color for the price (e.g., green or blue), and a distinct background color for the "Add to Cart" button (e.g., a contrasting color like blue or orange).
- **Font:** Use a clear, readable font for product name and description (e.g., sans-serif like Open Sans, Roboto, or system default). Consider using a slightly different font or font-weight for the product name to make it stand out.
- **Imagery:** Use a placeholder image for the product (you can provide a sample image or instruct them to use a placeholder image URL).

## Specific Requirements and Tasks:

1.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`):**

    - Create an HTML structure for the product card using semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<article>` for the card container, `<img>`, `<h2>` for product name, `<p>` for description, `<div>` or `<span>` for price, `<button>` for "Add to Cart").
    - Ensure your HTML is well-formed and uses proper semantic tags to represent the product information.

2.  **CSS Styling (`styles.css`):**

    - **Card Container:**
      - Style the main container (`<article>` or `<div>`) to have a defined width, background color, rounded corners (using `border-radius`), and a subtle box-shadow to give it depth.
      - Center the card on the page or within its parent container using appropriate CSS layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid, or margin auto).
      - Add padding and margin to control spacing within and around the card.
    - **Product Image:**
      - Style the product image (`<img>`) to fit nicely within the card, ensuring it's responsive and doesn't overflow its container. You can use `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;`.
    - **Product Name, Description, Price:**
      - Style the product name (`<h2>`) to be visually prominent (larger font size, bolder, different color if desired).
      - Style the product description (`<p>`) for readability and appropriate font size and color.
      - Style the price element (`<div>` or `<span>`) to stand out, possibly using a different color and font-weight.
    - **"Add to Cart" Button:**
      - Style the "Add to Cart" button (`<button>`) to be visually appealing and interactive. Use a distinct background color, text color, padding, border-radius, and a hover effect (e.g., change background color on hover).

3.  **Code Quality:**
    - Write clean, well-indented, and commented HTML and CSS code.
    - Use meaningful class names and IDs in your CSS.
    - Ensure your code is free of syntax errors.
