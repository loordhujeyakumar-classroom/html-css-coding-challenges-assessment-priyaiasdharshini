# HTML & CSS Assessment for Junior Developers

Welcome to the HTML & CSS Assessment! This assessment is designed to evaluate your understanding of HTML and CSS concepts and your practical coding and code review skills.

This assessment consists of **three parts**:

**Part 1: Conceptual Quiz (Individual, Online Quiz)**

- **Instructions:** First, you **must** complete the conceptual quiz to assess your foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS. This quiz is a prerequisite for proceeding to the coding challenges and the code review exercise.
- **Quiz Link:** [HTML & CSS Conceptual Quiz](https://forms.gle/EJLSqEBoNs8MDd3JA)
- **Access:** The quiz is online and accessible via the link provided above.
- **Completion:** Complete the quiz **before** starting Part 2 (Coding Challenges) and Part 3 (Code Review Exercise). Your quiz score will be automatically recorded.

**Part 2: Coding Challenges (Individual, GitHub Repository)**

- **Instructions:** After successfully completing the Conceptual Quiz (Part 1), you are required to choose and complete **any two** out of the following three coding challenges.
- Each challenge is located in its own folder within this repository and contains a `README.md` file with detailed specifications, design descriptions, and assessment criteria specific to that challenge.
- **Coding Challenges:**

  1.  [Navigation Bar Challenge](./coding_challenges/navigation-bar-challenge/README.md) - Focuses on HTML navigation structure and CSS layout using Flexbox, styling navigation links, and basic responsiveness.
  2.  [Product Card Challenge](./coding_challenges/product-card-challenge/README.md) - Focuses on HTML structure for content blocks, CSS for card layouts, styling text, images, buttons, and using visual enhancements like box-shadow and border-radius.
  3.  [Form Styling Challenge](./coding_challenges/form-styling-challenge/README.md) - Focuses on HTML form elements, CSS for styling form elements, improving form layout and spacing, and basic form usability.

- **Task:**

  - **Choose two challenges:** Select any two challenges that you find most interesting or that best allow you to demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills.
  - **Develop your solution:** For each chosen challenge, create `index.html` and `styles.css` files (and any necessary images) within the respective challenge folder in your repository.
  - Write clean, well-structured HTML and effective CSS code to meet all the requirements outlined in the `README.md` file for each challenge.
  - **Commit your code regularly:** Use Git to commit your code changes frequently with descriptive commit messages as you work on the challenges.

- **Submission for Coding Challenges:**

  - Your submission for the coding challenges is your work within this GitHub repository.
  - Ensure that your code for each chosen challenge is present in the correct folder (`navigation-bar-challenge`, `product-card-challenge`, or `form-styling-challenge`) and that you have committed your changes to the repository.
  - No separate submission step is required after pushing your code to GitHub. Your work will be reviewed directly in your repository.

- **Assessment Criteria for Coding Challenges (General):**
  Your code for each chosen coding challenge will be assessed based on the following criteria. **Refer to the `README.md` file within each challenge folder for more specific criteria for each challenge.**

  - **HTML Structure:**
    - Correctness and validity of HTML code.
    - Semantic HTML5 usage and appropriate tag selection.
    - Logical and well-organized HTML structure.
  - **CSS Styling & Layout:**
    - Effectiveness of CSS in achieving the desired visual design and layout.
    - Proper use of CSS properties and values.
    - Clean, organized, and maintainable CSS code.
    - Appropriate use of layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid, etc., as applicable to the challenge).
  - **Responsiveness (Where Applicable):**
    - If responsiveness is required in the challenge, how well the design adapts to different screen sizes.
  - **Visual Design & User Experience:**
    - Overall visual appeal and aesthetics of the design.
    - User-friendliness and clarity of the design.
  - **Code Quality:**
    - Code readability and clarity (HTML and CSS).
    - Use of comments to explain code (where appropriate).
    - Adherence to best practices.

**Part 3: Code Review Exercise (Individual, GitHub Repository)**

- **Instructions:** After completing Part 1 (Conceptual Quiz) and Part 2 (Coding Challenges), you are required to complete a Code Review Exercise.
- **Task:**

  - Navigate to the `code-review-exercise` folder in this repository.
  - Inside this folder, you will find:
    - `index.html`: An HTML file containing code with intentional bugs/errors.
    - `styles.css`: A CSS file associated with the HTML file, also potentially containing errors.
    - `README.md`: This file (you are reading it now) contains the instructions for the code review exercise.
  - **Your task is to:**
    1.  **Identify Bugs:** Carefully examine the `index.html` and `styles.css` files in the `code-review-exercise` folder. Identify as many HTML and CSS bugs, errors, and areas for improvement as you can find. These could be syntax errors, semantic issues, styling problems, accessibility issues, or areas where the code could be written more efficiently or following best practices.
    2.  **Fix Bugs (in place):** Correct the bugs and errors directly within the `index.html` and `styles.css` files. Edit the files to fix the issues you identify.
    3.  **Document your changes:** In the `code-review-exercise/README.md` file, create a **"Code Review Report"** section. In this section, clearly document **all** the bugs and errors you found and fixed. For each bug, explain:
        - **Description of the bug:** What was the issue? (e.g., "Missing closing tag for `<img>`", "Incorrect CSS selector", "Accessibility issue with missing `alt` attribute").
        - **Location of the bug:** Specify the file and line number(s) where the bug was found (e.g., "index.html, line 15", "styles.css, line 22").
        - **How you fixed it:** Explain the change you made to correct the bug and why it fixes the issue. (e.g., "Added closing `</img>` tag", "Corrected selector to target the correct element", "Added `alt` attribute with a descriptive text").

- **Submission for Code Review Exercise:**

  - Your submission for the Code Review Exercise is your **edited code files (`index.html` and `styles.css` in the `code-review-exercise` folder) and your "Code Review Report" in the `code-review-exercise/README.md` file.**
  - Ensure that your corrected code and the code review report are committed to your repository.
  - No separate submission step is needed after pushing your changes. Your work will be reviewed directly in your repository.

- **Assessment Criteria for Code Review Exercise:**
  Your performance in the Code Review Exercise will be assessed based on:

  - **Bug Identification**
    - Thoroughness in finding bugs and errors in the provided code.
    - Accuracy in identifying actual issues (not just stylistic preferences).
    - Identifying a range of different types of bugs (HTML structure, CSS styling, accessibility, etc.).
  - **Bug Fixing**
    - Correctness of your fixes. Do your changes actually resolve the identified bugs?
    - Efficiency and appropriateness of your fixes.
  - **Code Review Report Quality**
    - Clarity and detail of your bug descriptions and explanations of fixes in the report.
    - Organization and readability of your report.

**General Submission Instructions for the Entire Assessment (Parts 1, 2, and 3):**

- **GitHub Repository:** All your work for Part 2 (Coding Challenges) and Part 3 (Code Review Exercise) must be completed and submitted within this GitHub repository that you received upon accepting the assignment.
- **Commit Regularly:** For Parts 2 and 3, commit your code changes frequently with meaningful commit messages as you progress through the tasks. This demonstrates good version control practice and allows instructors to follow your development process.
- **No Separate Submission:** For Parts 2 and 3, there is no separate "submit" button to click. Once you have completed the challenges and the code review exercise and pushed your final commits to your repository, your work is considered submitted.

**Important Notes:**

- **Choose Two Coding Challenges:** Remember to select and complete only **two** out of the three coding challenges provided in Part 2.
- **Complete All Three Parts:** To get a complete assessment, you must complete **all three parts**: the Conceptual Quiz (Part 1), two Coding Challenges (Part 2), and the Code Review Exercise (Part 3).
- **Ask Questions:** If you encounter any difficulties, have questions about the instructions, or need clarification on anything, please don't hesitate to ask your instructor for assistance.
